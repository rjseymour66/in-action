This is a test file to see if I can write a reader and a writer in go.
I think I should be able to do it, but some of this stuff is more difficult
than I remember it being. I am glad that I am finally learning a language 
that seems to allow me to do cool stuff with it, rather than just read text-
books and do exercises.

However, I still have some exercises to do to learn Go...
